## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Utility

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by category by clicking on the table header.

  * USe the search bar to filter the users by name.
